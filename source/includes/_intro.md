# Welcome!
We're thrilled that you're here to learn more about the Dexter platform&mdash;we make it easy for people to connect services across the web and build apps that automate your digital life. If you haven't completed our [walkthrough tutorial](https://rundexter.com/app/?tutorial=build) and built a fully-functioning app yet, please do that first before continuing. Otherwise, dive in below for a more [in-depth explanation](#) of the walkthrough and [overview of the platform](#what-is-a-dexter-app).

Developers, if you're here to learn more about modules and how to create & deploy them to Dexter, you can jump right to the [SDK Overview](#sdk-overview) and [Module Building Tutorial](#tutorial).

If you're looking for help using Dexter apps (as opposed to building them), you can get in touch with us (<a href="mailto:info@rundexter.com">email</a> or <a href="http://rundexter.slack.com" target="_blank">Slack</a>) or the creator of the app directly.
